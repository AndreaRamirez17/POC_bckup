## Safe Deployment Gate Configuration Matrix

| Critical Count | Resource Set Match | User Role | Gate Type | Decision | Exit Code | Action |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Safe Deployment Gate | Any | Safe Deployment | ALLOW | 0/1* | Deploy Safely |
| > 0 | Base Deployment | developer/ci-pipeline | Access Denied | DENY | 2 | Block Deployment |
| > 0 | Base Deployment | editor/Security Officer | Override Gate | ALLOW | 0 | Override with Audit |

*Exit Code 0 for clean builds, 1 for builds with high/medium vulnerabilities (non-blocking)

### Resource Set Matching Logic

| Condition | Resource Set | Matches When | Available To |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `criticalCount = 0` | Safe Deployment Gate | No critical vulnerabilities | All roles (developer, editor, Security Officer, ci-pipeline) |
| `criticalCount > 0` | Base Deployment | Critical vulnerabilities present | Override roles only (editor, Security Officer) |

### Vulnerability Level Processing (After Resource Set Match)

| Vulnerability Profile | Safe Deployment Gate Match | Result | Exit Code |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------|-----------|
| No vulnerabilities | ‚úÖ YES | Clean Safe Deployment | 0 |
| High/Medium only | ‚úÖ YES | Safe Deployment with Warnings/Info | 1 |
| Critical present | ‚ùå NO | Falls back to Base Deployment | Depends on role |

## Recommendations by Gate Type

### Hard Gate Failure (Critical Vulnerabilities)
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Stop deployment pipeline
   - Identify critical vulnerabilities
   - Assess exploitability and impact
   - Prioritize remediation

2. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Apply security patches
   - Test fixes thoroughly
   - Re-run security scan

3. **Exception Process**:
   - Document business justification
   - Get security team approval
   - Use editor override with audit trail
   - Implement post-deployment remediation plan

### Soft Gate Warning (High Vulnerabilities)
1. **Review Process**:
   - Assess vulnerability impact
   - Check for available patches
   - Evaluate deployment timing
   - Plan remediation window

2. **Deployment Decision**:
   - Proceed with caution
   - Monitor for exploitation
   - Schedule immediate remediation
   - Document acceptance of risk

### Info Gate (Medium Vulnerabilities)
1. **Planning Actions**:
   - Add to security backlog
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Monitor for severity escalation
   - Include in next sprint planning

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Keep dependencies current
   - Regular security scanning
   - Vulnerability management process
   - Security awareness training
