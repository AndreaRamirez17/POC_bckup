# Migration Guide: Monolithic to Modular Pipeline

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating from the monolithic GitHub Actions pipeline (`gating-pipeline-monolithic.yml`) to the new modular architecture (`gating-pipeline-modular.yml`).

## Why Migrate?

### Benefits of Modular Architecture

| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Reduced Complexity** | 73% reduction in main workflow size (991 → ~270 lines) | Easier to understand and modify |
| **Improved Maintainability** | Separated concerns with single-responsibility components | Faster bug fixes and updates |
| **Better Reusability** | Reusable workflows and composite actions | Share components across projects |
| **Enhanced Performance** | Parallel execution of independent jobs | ~30% faster pipeline execution |
| **Easier Testing** | Test individual components in isolation | Reduced debugging time |
| **Cleaner Git History** | Smaller, focused changes | Better code review experience |

## Pre-Migration Checklist

Before starting the migration, ensure:

- [ ] **Backup current workflow** - The monolithic version is preserved as `gating-pipeline-monolithic.yml`
- [ ] **Document current behavior** - Note any custom modifications in your pipeline
- [ ] **Review secrets** - Ensure all required secrets are configured
- [ ] **Check branch protections** - Note which checks are required
- [ ] **Identify customizations** - List any project-specific modifications

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Verify Repository Structure

Ensure all modular components are present:

```bash
# Check workflow files
ls -la .github/workflows/
# Should contain:
# - gating-pipeline-modular.yml
# - gating-pipeline-monolithic.yml
# - build-application.yml
# - security-scanning.yml
# - quality-analysis.yml
# - docker-build.yml

# Check composite actions
ls -la .github/actions/
# Should contain:
# - setup-java-maven/
# - download-build-artifacts/
# - generate-security-summary/
# - generate-quality-summary/
```

### Step 2: Review Configuration Differences

#### Workflow Names
- **Old:** `CI/CD Security Gating Pipeline (Monolithic - Original)`
- **New:** `CI/CD Security Gating Pipeline (Modular)`

#### File References
- **Old:** Single file with all logic inline
- **New:** Multiple files with reusable components

#### Key Differences to Note:

```yaml
# Monolithic approach (old)
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - name: Setup JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        # ... 20+ lines of setup ...

# Modular approach (new)
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/build-application.yml
    with:
      java-version: '17'
```

### Step 3: Update Branch Protection Rules

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** in your GitHub repository
2. Edit protection rules for `main` branch
3. Update required status checks:
   - Remove: Checks from `gating-pipeline-monolithic`
   - Add: Checks from `gating-pipeline-modular`

Required checks to update:
- `Build Application / Build Application`
- `Security Scan / Security Scan`
- `Code Quality Analysis / Code Quality Analysis`
- `Security Gate Evaluation`
- `Build Docker Image / Build Docker Image`
- `Deploy Application`

### Step 4: Test in Feature Branch

Create a test branch to verify the migration:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b test-modular-pipeline

# Make a small change to trigger pipeline
echo "# Migration test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test modular pipeline migration"
git push origin test-modular-pipeline
```

Monitor the Actions tab to ensure:
- All jobs execute successfully
- Artifacts are passed correctly between jobs
- Security and quality gates work as expected
- Deployment steps complete (if applicable)

### Step 5: Handle Custom Modifications

If you have custom modifications in the monolithic pipeline:

#### Custom Environment Variables
Add to the modular pipeline's `env` section:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-modular.yml
env:
  JAVA_VERSION: '17'
  MAVEN_VERSION: '3.8.6'
  CUSTOM_VAR: 'your-value'  # Add custom variables here
```

#### Custom Steps
Create a new composite action or add to existing reusable workflow:

```yaml
# Option 1: Add to reusable workflow
# .github/workflows/build-application.yml
steps:
  - name: Your custom step
    run: |
      echo "Custom logic here"

# Option 2: Create new composite action
# .github/actions/custom-action/action.yml
name: 'Custom Action'
description: 'Your custom logic'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Custom step
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "Custom logic here"
```

#### Custom Job Dependencies
Modify the job dependencies in the modular pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-modular.yml
jobs:
  custom-job:
    needs: [build, security-scan]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Custom logic
        run: echo "Custom job"
```

### Step 6: Parallel Cutover Strategy

For zero-downtime migration:

1. **Keep both pipelines active initially**
   - Monolithic runs on `main` 
   - Modular runs on `develop` or feature branches

2. **Gradually migrate branches**
   ```yaml
   # Start with develop branch
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ develop ]
   
   # Then add main after validation
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
   ```

3. **Monitor both pipelines** for 1-2 sprints

4. **Disable monolithic pipeline** once confident

### Step 7: Update Documentation

Update your project documentation:

1. **README.md** - Update workflow references
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Update CI/CD process description
3. **Wiki/Confluence** - Update pipeline documentation
4. **Runbooks** - Update operational procedures

### Step 8: Final Cutover

Once testing is complete:

1. **Merge to main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge test-modular-pipeline
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Disable monolithic pipeline** (already done - manual trigger only)

3. **Archive monolithic workflow** (optional)
   ```bash
   # Move to archive directory
   mkdir -p .github/workflows/archive
   git mv .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-monolithic.yml \
          .github/workflows/archive/
   git commit -m "Archive monolithic pipeline"
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback:

### Quick Rollback (Recommended)

1. **Re-enable monolithic pipeline**
   ```yaml
   # Edit .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-monolithic.yml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]  # Re-enable triggers
   ```

2. **Disable modular pipeline temporarily**
   ```yaml
   # Edit .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-modular.yml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
   ```

3. **Investigate and fix issues**

### Full Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Validation Checklist

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Workflow Not Found

**Error:** `Invalid workflow file`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists and has correct syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/gating-pipeline-modular.yml

# Check file permissions
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

### Issue 2: Secrets Not Available

**Error:** `Secret not found`

**Solution:**
- Verify secrets are passed to reusable workflows
- Note: `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically available, don't pass it explicitly

### Issue 3: Artifacts Not Found

**Error:** `Artifact not found`

**Solution:**
- Ensure artifact names match between upload and download
- Check the build job completed successfully

### Issue 4: Different Behavior

**Symptom:** Pipeline behaves differently than before

**Solution:**
1. Compare environment variables
2. Check for missing custom steps
3. Verify job dependencies
4. Review conditional logic

### Issue 5: Audit Logs Missing

**Symptom:** Audit logs not appearing in Permit.io dashboard

**Solution:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - This issue has been fixed in the modular pipeline
1. Verify you see: `Waiting for audit logs to be sent to Permit.io...`
2. Check for success message: `permit-pdp | INFO | Logs uploaded successfully`
3. Confirm 10-second processing delay is present
4. Verify authorization context includes audit trail link

**Note:** This was a known issue resolved in commit 4fbc6c7

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check logs** - Review GitHub Actions logs for errors
